                                    (TNEW) site to help improve footfall and reduce the friction experienced by walk-in
                                    visitors.

                                <h3>A digital Autumn season with Opera North</h3>
                                <p class="our-work-item-paragraph-p">We worked with the wonderful team at Opera North to
                                    launch a season of digital
                                    content
                                    following the disruption of their
                                    2020 autumn season plans (no thanks to Covid). We implemented our live streaming
                                    platform [showcase], which resulted in
                                    Opera North beating their ticket sales and revenue targets by +154%.
